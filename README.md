# The Iron Glory App

### An eCommerce app for selling retro patches

This is a June 2016 Indianapolis Iron Yard Cohort production (class project). On Monday, August 8, 2016, we were contacted by a "Collin" of Iron Glory, a retro patch redistributor. Our goal: to create an eCommerce store where "Collin" is able to make lots of money selling patches that he and his merry band of mischief makers have been pilfering from flea markets and garage sales across the country for the last year. Our timeline: 96 hours. The question is: are we going to make a fully operational eCommerce app for Collin by 3pm EST on Friday, August 12, 2016?

## Deployment

* Rails 5

This app may be viewed on Heroku at [Iron Glory]( https://arcane-harbor-93523.herokuapp.com/).
_Warning:_ Patches may or may not be available. We are unsure if the patches really exist. We think there might be something scandalous going on here, but since our client has offered to pay us (in cinnamon rolls), we are bound by contract to complete the project. (Please do not attempt to purchase the patches with an actual credit card.)

## Contributions

Due to the nature of this app (class project), contributions are ill-advised. But you are more than welcome to fork and clone the repo locally.
